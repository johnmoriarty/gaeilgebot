A little tool that offers layman's (non-IPA) pronunciations for Irish words. Running at agitated-hugle-7a0d78.netlify.app

Please feel free to contribute and improve this tool. My Irish is worse than my Javascript, and you can see how efficient that is. I'm happy to see code improvements, though I'm less concerned about improving performance than I am about getting the pronunciations correct and presenting them in a clear and user-friendly way.

In addition to correcting/fleshing out the pronunciation rules and adding exceptions, I'd love any suggestions about better "as in" sounds to suggest as well.
